# FinalProject (Simple EnrollmentSystem with GUI Forms)

The Project file of Account Class ("Register") & User Class ("Login") is separated to the other classes since the codes of Account and User Class should have their own database in the Mysql with XAMMP application. Therefore the remaining three classes have also another Project file. The purpose of separating the codes of the first two classes is for instance that you've successfully registered and login into the system, if you run the Main code of the project file of the remaining three classes with their codes you will eventually access the system as a user.


The EnrollmentSytem Contains:
* Account Class ("Register")
* User Class ("Login")
* Registration Class ("Personal Information of a certain user")
* Course Class ("Courses")
* Requirements Class ("Required to submit in order to Enroll the user")
